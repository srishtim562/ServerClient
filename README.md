# ServerClient
This is a multithreaded server-client interface developed using socket programming in C. The server listens on a port (for example, port 9002). The client (running on a different terminal, or a different PC / laptop) connects to the server by providing the server's IP address and the number of requests it wishes to make. The client makes a request by entering the name of a file, which is present on the server's side. The server reads the file, and sends the data in the file to the client. In case the file does not exist, the appropriate error message is displayed. I have provided 2 text files in order to test the program.
